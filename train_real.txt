tax laws in kazakhstan have changed  frequently in recent years  it is therefore  important that tax planning be robust   i e   so it can cope with changes in  tax law and be restructured without  significant tax costs  
corporate and individual income  tax rates in kazakhstan are low  by international standards  but  penalties for nonpayment and nonreporting   whether intentional or  not  are high  the first focus of tax  planning in kazakhstan should be  to confirm that all tax that ought to  be paid in kazakhstan is paid and  reported  in addition  kazakhstan  is a documentation driven country   and keeping documentation in order   including support documentation  is  of paramount importance  
the scope of withholding taxes  whts   on cross border payments is wide   and rates are high  sometimes even  when the recipient has never entered  kazakhstan   however  kazakhstan  has concluded tax treaties with  many counties  and it is possible that  withholding taxes can be reduced or  avoided in transactions with treaty  countries if the taxpayer has all the  necessary documentation in place   otherwise  tax will be withheld  and  obtaining a refund may be a complex  and time consuming process with  an uncertain outcome  moreover   kazakhstan has a unique position in  regard to transfer pricing  control  potentially applies to all cross border  transactions  regardless of whether  the parties are in any way related  
there are many downsides to dealing  with tax havens when structuring  cross border investments or  transactions in kazakhstan  thus  tax  havens should not usually form part of  tax planning in kazakhstan  
the rules for determining whether a  business dealing with kazakhstan has a  taxable presence for corporate income  tax  cit  purposes in kazakhstan   a permanent establishment  are  very broad and can apply collectively  to whole groups of companies if  they have been in the country for  over six months  some  but not all   of kazakhstan s tax treaties protect  against this  therefore  if more than  one group entity is used to do business  with kazakhstan  the position of all  entities involved must be reviewed  collectively  
the rules for determining whether  there is a taxable presence for vat  purposes are independent of the rules  for cit  and the penalties for violations  can be draconian  never forget to  consider vat separately when thinking  about whether you have a taxable  presence in kazakhstan     for financing investments  there is a  basic 4 1 debt to equity ratio  7 1 for  banks   an investor will  at best  pay  10  wht on cross border interest   under a double tax treaty  and get  a cit deduction of 20   while on  certain borrowings  accrued interest  expense may be deducted only when  paid  furthermore  exchange gains  and losses on loans are recognized for  tax purposes  
there is a safe harbor allows an entity  that seconds staff to kazakhstan to  avoid a taxable presence  provided the  arrangements are properly structured   this is likely to be more  tax efficient than using the same  staff to provide consultancy or  other services     branch profit tax applies to all  permanent establishments of foreign  legal entities at a general rate of 15    it is usually reduced by tax treaties   there is an equivalent tax on dividends  at the same general rate  which is  also reduced by treaties  in the case  of dividends  the rate is zero after an  investment has been held for three  years  except for investments in oil  and gas or mining  dividends paid  to tax haven registered entities and  investments in certain cit exempt  entities   
an exemption from capital gains tax  may  in many cases  be obtained  upon withdrawal from an investment  in kazakhstan  provided that the  correct structuring is used when the  investment is first made  how complex  the structuring is depends on the  nature of the asset 
most investors use a kazakhstan  limited liability partnership  llp   as their investment vehicle  
settlements between residents of  kazakhstan  kazakh legal entities  and citizens  must be made in kzt   settlements between nonresidents   foreign legal entities and citizens  and  kazakh residents may generally be  made in any currency  
the range of business and professional  activities that require licensing is very  broad  and it is important for investors  to determine whether they need a  license beforehand  the penalties for  not having licenses can be significant  
obtaining work permits is a rather  complex process  so it is important to  plan this process well in advance  
a  brass plate  legal address is not  sufficient in practice  the authorities  will expect an investor to have some  presence at its registered legal address  in kazakhstan  
kazakhstan is very formalistic in many  respects  in most cases  a company s  representatives should have a power of  attorney and will regularly be required  to refer to it   for example  when  signing contracts  
local content is very important for  mining and oil and gas companies and  their subcontractors  and is constantly  being monitored by the state  authorities  
kazakh is the state language of  kazakhstan  russian is an official  language and may be used on an  equal footing with kazakh  in addition   transactions must be  expressed  in  the kazakh language  english is not  normally recognized as an official  language  thus  english documents  will normally have to be translated  into kazakh  and  in certain instances   into russian   and the translations  must be certified  the only exception  to this rule is the recently established  astana international financial center   aifc   where the official language of  acts  judicial proceedings  participants   internal documentation and contracts  is english  
for commercial contracts  kazakhstan  generally permits foreign law to be the  governing law  except for subsoil use  contracts with the state  foundation  agreements of a kazakhstan legal  entity and agreements on the transfer  of participation shares in a legal entity   in addition  it is specifically provided  that the aifc s acts governing relations  between aifc participants may be  based on the  principles  norms and  cases  of the law of england and  wales and standards of international  financial centers  
international arbitration is not usually  available for contracts between  kazakhstan legal entities  disputes  between kazakhstan legal entities are  resolved either by the courts or by  local arbitration  at the same time   local aifc participants have access to  the aifc s own international arbitration  center  whose decisions are expected  to be recognized and enforced similarly  to the decisions of arbitration courts  in kazakhstan  rules applying to the  aifc s own international arbitration  center have not yet been adopted   should you need more information  on any of these issues  ey is happy  to assist you in the following areas  
 citizens of most foreign countries will need  a visa to visit kazakhstan  each type of visa  has certain categories  e g   a business visa  has categories from d1 to d8  depending  on the purpose of the business trip   
on 26 june 2015  the government of  kazakhstan issued a resolution expanding  the number of countries included in a trial  visa free regime and extended that regime  until 31 december 2017  the list now  includes the following 19 countries  australia netherlands  belgium norway  finland  singapore  france  spain  germany  sweden  hungary  switzerland  italy  united arab emirates  japan  united kingdom  malaysia  united states of america  monaco 
during this period  citizens of these  19 countries who have passports  or  the equivalent documents  will be able  to enter and leave kazakhstan multiple  times without a visa and stay for up to  15 calendar days  if the period of their stay  exceeds this  the respective kazakhstan  visa should be applied for  
passports should be valid for at least three  months after the visa expiration date  
the most popular visas are investor   business and work visas  they are issued  for one  two  three or multiple entries   depending on their categories  and are  valid for up to three years  
investor visas are issued to management  of foreign companies that carry out  investment activities in kazakhstan  as well  as to their family members  
work visas are issued to foreign individuals  arriving in kazakhstan for employment   as well as to non working members of  their families  a work permit should be  submitted to the kazakhstan foreign affairs  authorities in order to obtain a work visa   see the  work permits  section for details  
business visas are issued to foreign  individuals arriving in kazakhstan for  business purposes  e g   a business trip   negotiations  to enter into contracts   provide consultancy or audit services   attend conferences  symposiums   forums  exhibitions and concerts  as well  as cultural  scientific  sports and other  events   
visas are issued in kazakhstan by the  consular service department of the  kazakhstan ministry of foreign affairs   mfa  and  abroad  by kazakhstan  consulates  e g   the consular department  of the embassy of kazakhstan   generally   visas are issued based on a letter of  invitation by a local kazakh company   or a branch or representative office of  a foreign company  submitted to the  consular service department of the  kazakhstan mfa  the fee for a visa ranges  from us 1 to us 600  depending on the  invited person s country of residence and  the type of visa sought  visas should be  issued within five working days  
a letter of invitation is not required for a  single entry diplomatic  official  business  or private visa in certain categories  or  for a single  or double entry tourist visa  for citizens of 48 countries  including  austria  belgium  uk  greece  italy   france  singapore and the united states   this type of visa is issued based on  a written application submitted by a  foreign individual to the kazakh consular  establishment in the respective country or  to the consular service department of the  kazakhstan mfa  
the registration of foreign nationals  arriving in kazakhstan is recorded on their  migration card  except for those arriving  under investor visas  whose registration  is recorded in their passports  depending  on the visa category and the grounds for  its issuance  registration is handled by the  kazakh consulates when a visa is issued  by  the border control authority when a foreign  national crosses the border  or by the  migration police within five days after the  arrival of a foreign national  
under the civil code  foreign and local investors may use a number of  organizational and legal forms to do  business in kazakhstan  including  general partnerships  llps  partnerships  with additional liability  commandite  partnerships and joint stock companies   corporations   as well as representative  and branch offices  
in this section  we expand on the four types  of business vehicles that are most widely  used in practice  
a jsc is a legal entity that is separate  and distinct from its shareholders   i e   shareholders are not liable for jsc s  liabilities  it may have one or more  shareholders  the minimum capital  required for a jsc is 50 000 times  the monthly calculation index  mci    approximately us 300 000   
the main difference between the two  entities  jsc and llp  is that an llp does not issue  shares  instead  participants have interests  in the partnership  an llp may be formed  by one or more participants  generally  the  participants of an llp are not liable for  the llp s debts beyond the value of their  contributions  the civil code envisages a  number of exceptions to this rule  
the minimum capital requirement for an  llp is 100 times the mci  approximately  us 600   with the exception of small  businesses  for which the minimum is  set at zero  participants  interests are  proportional to their contributions to  the charter capital unless the foundation  documents provide otherwise  participants  have preemptive rights to each other s  interests  
importantly  llps in kazakhstan are  separate legal entities that are distinct  from their participants  as a legal entity   an llp is subject to state registration  and taxation in its own right  i e    it is not tax transparent  
kazakh law allows a foreign company  to establish a representative office in  kazakhstan to represent its interests  in kazakhstan  a representative office  protects and represents the interests  of a foreign legal entity and carries out  preparatory and auxiliary activities  such  as marketing and advertising  generally   a representative office may not conduct  commercial activity  a representative office  is not recognized as a separate legal entity  
a branch is a structural subdivision of a  foreign legal entity that performs all or  part of the foreign entity s functions and   in particular  can carry on commercial  activity  a branch is not considered to be a  legal entity separate from its foreign parent  company  head office   
state registration in kazakhstan follows a   one stop shop  principle  all registration  documents must be submitted to a single  government authority  the public service  center  tson   under the law on state  registration  the procedure should take  from 1 to 14 business days  in practice   general registration can take up to one  month  
legislation requires that a standard set of  documents be submitted to complete an  entity s state registration  having all the  right documents is the key to a successful  registration process  it is essential to  confirm that the documents have been duly  signed  sealed  notarized and legalized   or apostilled if they are executed abroad   otherwise  the registration process may be  considerably delayed  
the state registration fee is currently  6 5 times the mci  approximately us 39  
as soon as state registration has been  completed  some entities need to apply  to obtain a seal from an authorized local  company  this a company may design  and produce a seal and register it with the  kazakh state authorities  
 a legal entity s location is the address  indicated in its foundation  e g   charter   documents  under kazakh law  a legal  entity is located in the same place as its  operating governing body  i e   its director  or board of directors   the location plays  an important part in a legal entity s  registration and other legal events  such as  determination of the court where an appeal  should be filed  usually with a court in the  defendant s location  or the state revenue  authority to which tax and other payments  will be made  
under kazakh law  state authorities  in  particular  the state revenue authorities   require legal entities  branches and  representative offices   entities   to be  present at the legal addresses indicated  in their foundation documents and the  authorities  registration data  the state  revenue authorities can visit them at  their legal address under the so called   observation procedure   
if an entity is not actually present  at the legal address  i e   the state  revenue authorities cannot find anyone  representing this entity at the time of  observation  it may be penalized  i e   it  may be de registered for vat purposes  or its bank accounts may be frozen   thus  a branch should actually be at the  legal address stipulated in its foundation  documents and registration data  or at  least confirm that  if the authorities visit   send correspondence or call the contact  telephone number   there is someone who  can confirm that the branch is in fact at  that legal address  
bank accounts can be opened with a local  bank in kazakhstan in the national currency  and or in a foreign currency  
branches and representative offices  of foreign legal entities may opt to use  offshore  foreign  bank accounts  
kazakh legal entities are permitted to  hold bank accounts outside of kazakhstan  without restrictions  all they have to do  when opening such an account is to notify  the national bank of kazakhstan within  30 calendar days after an agreement is  concluded with a foreign bank and file  statutory reporting  
the law of the republic of kazakhstan on migration of the population  adopted on 22 july 2011  establishes the following categories of immigrants entering the country to perform labor  foreign employees  i e   immigrants engaged by employers  including as part  of an intracorporate transfer to perform  labor in kazakhstan  business immigrants  i e   those who conduct entrepreneurial activities under  the laws of the republic of kazakhstan  seasonal foreign employees  i e   immigrants engaged by employers to  perform seasonal work during a specific  period  season  in view of the climate  and other natural conditions  but for  no more than one year  immigrants who come to kazakhstan as homeworkers to perform work   render services  for an employer or  individual in a household under a labor  immigration permit 
the law on migration establishes specific  conditions for the arrival and stay in  kazakhstan of each of these categories of  labor immigrants  including  among other  things   i  verification of financial solvency   allowing them to leave kazakhstan for  their country of permanent residence  upon the expiration of their permits    ii  information on prior convictions  and   iii  medical confirmation allowing them  to work in kazakhstan in a particular  area of specialization   work permits 
under kazakh migration and work permit  law  there are two types of permit for labor  by foreign nationals in the republic of  kazakhstan     permit to engage foreign labor   work permit     permit issued to a foreign individual  arriving in kazakhstan for individual  employment in a certain area of  specialization  permit for employment    a list of such specializations is approved  by the government  
a work permit must be obtained by an  employer  while a permit for employment  must be obtained by the foreign employee   only one document need be obtained for a  foreign employee in kazakhstan  i e   either  a work permit or a permit for employment   these documents are not required for  citizens of armenia  belarus  kyrgyzstan  and russia  having local employment  agreement  under the treaty on the eaeu  of 29 may 2014  which envisages free  movement of labor within eaeu member  states  
pursuant to kazakhstan entering world  trade organization   wto    there is a new  option to attract the foreign labor force    intra corporate transfer  it represents a  temporary transfer of a foreign individual  who is in a position of head  manager or  specialist in a legal entity established in  the territory of a member country of the  wto outside kazakhstan to its kazakhstan  branches  subsidiaries or representative  offices  the work permit under intracorporate  transfer is issued by the local  authorities for a transfer period  but no  more than for 36 months with a right of  one time extension for a calendar year  
the work permits under intra corporate  transfer are issued out of the quota for  foreign labor force and apply to certain  established economic sectors  
in addition  the above conditions should  also apply to a transfer of employees from  a foreign company  no reference to wto   to its affiliated entity in kazakhstan  
as a general rule  under kazakh law   an employer hiring a foreign national is  required to obtain a work permit for the  employee  under the current laws of the  republic of kazakhstan  local executive  bodies  akimats  issue work permits  this  rule applies to all foreign employees except  those who are specifically exempt  such as  the heads of branches and representative  offices of foreign legal entities and  those on business trips  provided they  do not exceed a total of 120 days in one  calendar year  foreign employees of the  companies  employers  participating in  the implementation of projects included  in the list of the industrialization map of  kazakhstan for 2015 2019  and other  categories  
the government sets an annual quota  for work permits  employers submit an  application for a quota of work permits for  the following year prior to 1 september  of the current year  as a rule  the number  of available work permits has always been  limited  so early application is important   the process of obtaining a work permit is  quite lengthy and requires collection of a  certain set of documents  
work permits are usually granted for  one year  in order to obtain a work  permit  companies  except for those  exempt from this requirement  e g    representative offices of foreign legal  entities in kazakhstan or small businesses    must comply with the required ratio of  kazakhstan local employees to foreign  nationals

secondment of foreign personnel is  currently a key topic in kazakhstan s  job market  
the tax code provides a safe harbor   allowing a foreign entity  that provides  secondees from outside of kazakhstan   to avoid being taxed in kazakhstan   this provision requires that certain  conditions be met  
under a secondment  the local host  company acts as a tax agent  and is  responsible for calculating and reporting  personal income tax liabilities for  seconded individuals
